# **THE GENESIS PROTOCOL 2.0: GLOBAL VALUE CAPTURE**

*Strategic Go-To-Market*

To reach a $500M valuation in 18 months, we don't just sell software; we embed our intelligence into the global supply chain. We capture value in three compounding layers.

### **LAYER 1: STRATEGIC DESIGN PARTNERSHIPS (THE "FDE" MODEL)**

*Revenue Stream: High-Margin NRE & Forward Deployment Fees.*

We don't just solve "problems"; we design the future cell. By deploying **Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs)** directly into the R\&D centers of Tier-1 OEMs in Japan and Europe, we bridge the "Cultural and Technical Gap."

**The Model:** Partners (e.g., Tata, BMW, Panasonic) pay **3M-7M** for an 18-month "Design Sprint."

* **The Role:** Our engineers use SkandaX to design their next-gen Silicon or Sodium-Ion recipe on-site.  
* **The Goal:** It funds our global operations (non-dilutive) and ensures our software is the only one they trust to manufacture that design.

### **LAYER 2: THE "YIELD" OPERATING SYSTEM (SaaS)**

*Revenue Stream: Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) per Production Line.*

Once the design is finalized, the customer moves to the factory. This is where **SkandaX DEPLOY** becomes mission-critical.

**The Model:** A subscription fee (e.g., **250k-500k/year**) for every production line running our "Factory Guard" Edge Node.

* **The Value:** We aren't just software; we are **Yield Insurance.** If our AI prevents even one "Bad Batch" or reduces "Ramp-up Time" by 3 months, the software pays for itself 10x over.  
* **The Moat:** Once SkandaX is integrated into the factory’s sensors (PLC/MES), we are the "Operating System" of that facility. Switching costs become astronomical.

### **LAYER 3: THE "SOVEREIGN" ROYALTY (IP TAX)**

*Revenue Stream: Production Royalties (The "Intel Inside" Model).*

This is where the **$500M+ valuation** lives. Because we used SkandaX GENESIS to create the proprietary microstructure and the "Machine Recipe," we own the Intellectual Property of the material itself.

* **The Model:** We take a small "Technology Tax" (e.g., **$0.50 – $1.50 per kWh**) on every battery produced using a Shodh-proprietary design.  
* **The Logic:** This is **Exponential Upside.** As our partners scale from 1 GWh to 100 GWh, our revenue explodes with **Zero Marginal Cost.**  
* **Investor Note:** This layer turns Shodh AI into an **IP Powerhouse**, similar to ARM in semiconductors or Qualcomm in mobile.

### **THE GO-TO-MARKET (GTM) STRATEGY: 18-MONTH BLITZ**

1. **Months 0-6 (India):** Leverage the **IndiaAI Mission** to perfect the "Sovereign Prototype." Use domestic partners (Tata/Exide) as the initial proof-of-concept.  
2. **Months 6-12 (Global Deployment):** Open the **Munich and Tokyo "Frontier Offices."** Deploy FDE teams to secure 3 pilot partnerships with global OEMs.  
3. **Months 12-18 (Scaling):** Transition pilots into **Layer 2 (SaaS)** deployments and lock in **Layer 3 (Royalty)** contracts for next-gen models.
